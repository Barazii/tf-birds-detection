The first part is deploy a tensorflow SSD Resnet50 pretrained model to test its initial capability of detecting birds. (bad approach to deploy pretrained models from a pipeline-like standalone script)\
The second part is finetune the model on custom dataset of few bird classes/species to test feasibility of customizing pretrained models to predict new unseen classes.
